  <section name="Overview">
    <p>
     This Service functions as a BSF component.
   </p>

    <p>
      It is written for use in Turbine but it can be used in any container compatible
      with Avalon's ECM container.
    </p>

<section name="Configuration">

    <p>
      First, here is the role configuration.
    </p>

    <source>
    <![CDATA[
        <role
            name="org.apache.fulcrum.bsf.BSFService"
            shorthand="cache"
            default-class="org.apache.fulcrum.bsf.DefaultBSFService"/>
    ]]>
    </source>

      <p>
        And here is the configuration:
      </p>
    <source>

    <![CDATA[
        <bsf use-property-file="true" scriptsDirectory="WEB-INF/scripts" defaultExtension="py"/>

  <section name="Usage">

    <source><![CDATA[

    GlobalCacheService gs = null;
    try
    {
        /*
         * Look for the item in the cache.
         * If it doesn't exist or the item is stale,
         * the cache will throw an exception.
         */
        gs = (GlobalCacheService)avalonComponentService.lookup(GlobalCacheService.ROLE)

        CachedObject obj = gs.getObject("cached_object");

        data.setMessage( data.getScreen() + " Got " +
            obj.getContents().toString() + " from global cache!" );
    }
    catch(ObjectExpiredException gone)
    {
        /*
         * Add the item to the cache.
         */
        gs.addObject("cached_object",
            new CachedObject("in_the_cache",5000));

        data.setMessage( data.getScreen() +
            " Refreshed/or added new item to" +
            " the cache! Expires in 5 seconds" );
    }

    ]]></source>

    <p>
    You can also place an expiration time on your objects so the Service will
    automatically remove them when they expire. If you don't specify an expiration
    time, the Service uses 5 seconds. To see an example, look at the
    test case <a href="xref-test/org/apache/fulcrum/cache/CacheTest.html">CacheTest</a>

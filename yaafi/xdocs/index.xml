      <p>
        The Yet Another Avalon Framework Implementation.of an Avalon container.
      </p>

      <p>
        YAAFI is a light-weight implementation of a service framework using the
        Avalon service lifecycle interfaces aka Avalon container. There are a 
        few other implementations out there such as Phoenix, Fortress, Loom, 
        Keel and Merlin but YAAFI gives you a lot of bells and whistles with minimal baggage.
        The goal of the implementation is to provide a light-weight Avalon container
        to be embedded into existing applications and/or other containers.

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>logger manager implementation since this is done by log4j quite nicely</li>
            <li>run-time instrumentation to monitor application health</li>
            <li>service implementation versioning</li>
            <li>service initialization in a background thread</li>
            <li>support for singleton lifestyle only</li>
            <li>classloader hierarchies for components</li>
            <li>service selector implementation</li>
            <li>no javadoc tag support for automatically creating component decriptors</li>

      <subsection name="What we actually implemented">
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>a light-weight Avalon container only depending an the Avalone Framwork libraries</li>
            <li>a container which can run components written for ECM, Fortress, Phoenix and Merlin</li>
            <li>ability to be embedded in other Avalon containers such as Phoenix</li>
            <li>automatic reconfiguration for the whole Avalon container or individual services</li>
            <li>automatic shutdown of the whole Avalon container</li>
            <li>support for early or on-demand initialization</li>
            <li>support for encrypted configuration files</li>
            <li>dynamic proxies and service interceptors</li>

        Updated locale handling to use the new localized parameter parser. This
        removes the dependency from LocalizationService

        Added locale handling to Intake, added user-defined field types.

        Intake now handles the case where the mapToObject does not map to all
        fields in the group.

        Intake was not handling empty values correctly.

      	Intake was not loading the correct Default Validators when the rules for
      	a field are empty.

      	Update to Apache License 2.0

      <action dev="epugh" type="remove">
      	Remove Intake Pull Tool.  It should I think be part of Turbine as it is
      	very Turbine specific right now.  I am trying to remove all Turbine requirements
      	for Intake.
      </action>
      <action dev="epugh" type="add">
      	Added the Intake class which is a facade to the underlying IntakeService.
      </action>
      <action dev="epugh" type="fix">
       The intake validators were fixed so that fields with required=false
       rules no longer attempt to execute the remaining rules when no
       input is provided.  A minLength > 0 rule is no longer synonymous
       with required=true.  Patch originally supplied by Colin Chalmers
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Intake was fixed so that DateString will use the "formatn" (where n
       &gt;= 1) rules to parse the input and then the "format" rule to format
       it (the "format" rule is also used to parse the date if there are no
       "formatn" rules or they are not able to parse it).  In order to
       retrieve the correctly formatted DateString value you need to use
       <em>$group.foo.StringValue</em> rather than <em>$group.foo.Value</em>
       (you can do this for all values, not just DateString).
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Intake now makes use of the the emptyValue attribute from the field
       elements when mapping from the group to the object when no value has
       been set.  This makes it possible to clear values in an existing object
       that is being overwritten with Intake data using
       <em>group.setProperties(obj)</em> (or you can provide non-null values
       in your intake.xml file).  Make sure you do not inadvertently include
       the primary key for the object in the intake group without actually
       setting it to the appropriate value (it shouldn't be in the group
       anyway).
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Fixed the intake DateString flexible rule so that it applies to the
       format rules and not just to the default locale format.
      </action>

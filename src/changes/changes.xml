      	Added the Intake class which is a facade to the underlying IntakeService.
      </action>
      <action dev="epugh" type="fix">
       The intake validators were fixed so that fields with required=false
       rules no longer attempt to execute the remaining rules when no
       input is provided.  A minLength > 0 rule is no longer synonymous
       with required=true.  Patch originally supplied by Colin Chalmers
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Intake was fixed so that DateString will use the "formatn" (where n
       &gt;= 1) rules to parse the input and then the "format" rule to format
       it (the "format" rule is also used to parse the date if there are no
       "formatn" rules or they are not able to parse it).  In order to
       retrieve the correctly formatted DateString value you need to use
       $group.foo.StringValue rather than $group.foo.Value
       (you can do this for all values, not just DateString).
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Intake now makes use of the the emptyValue attribute from the field
       elements when mapping from the group to the object when no value has
       been set.  This makes it possible to clear values in an existing object
       that is being overwritten with Intake data using
       group.setProperties(obj) (or you can provide non-null values
       in your intake.xml file).  Make sure you do not inadvertently include
       the primary key for the object in the intake group without actually
       setting it to the appropriate value (it shouldn't be in the group
       anyway).
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Fixed the intake DateString flexible rule so that it applies to the
       format rules and not just to the default locale format.
      </action>
